# On-Site Drapery

The project exists because the client, OnSite Drapery, isn’t fully satisfied with the current business logistics. A combination of paid and free software/services led to unnecessary overhead and potential loss of sales or client satisfaction. The goals of this project are to optimize business logistics for OnSite Drapery Cleaning. Help the company to become more efficient, faster, less error-prone, and more satisfying to customers. Specifically, the web application should help OnSite Drapery Cleaning to solve these main problems: scheduling, billing, certifications, and web interface.

Last tested on a macOS Mojave system on November 13, 2019 by Elise Dixon.

# Testing

In order to run the test, install Jest. This is a testing framework that will execute .test.js files and yield the corresponding test results.
1) npm i jest superagent supertest
2) add the following script to package.json
    {"test: "jest"}
* if you want to watch jest to watch for changes, put {"test":"jest --watch"} instead.
3) run
    {npm run test}
* if you want to get a full test coverage report, put the following script in your package.json {"testCoverge": "jest --coverage"} and run {npm run testCoverage} in your terminal.

Jest can cover both unit and integration tests, simply putting them in separate files for structure will suffice.

Remember that in order for this to work, the test files have to be written according the jest api.

# Deployment

The production system live on Heroku. A new developer can gain access by join the developer team. We recommend developers to install the Heroku Command Line Interface to deploy the project. This would allow the user to login to heroku, clone the repository, and deploy back to the reposiroty. With Heroku, the only addon that we use is PostgreSQL that allows us to store the data in the database. Developers can use this method to continue to deploy projects to the Heroku host. 

# Technologies used
This application is built using a React frontend with a Node server and Express backend. The database is built using PostgresQL and it, as well as the rest of the application, is hosted using Heroku.

#### React
The React app is stored within the `/client` folder
#### Node.js and Express
This can be found within the `index.js` file
#### PostgresQL and Heroku
Heroku is used for hosting the web application and the PostgresQL database.
